# Brainit-QuizApp

 ## ABSTRACT
 Brainit is a quiz application developed utilizing Java Spring Boot as the backend, React.js as the frontend, and MySQL as the database. The application's API was thoroughly tested using Postman and implements RESTful API principles following the MVC architecture pattern.

On the frontend, React state management and React Router were extensively utilized for efficient navigation and state handling. The application is structured into two main modules: admin and user.

In the admin module, administrators have the capability to add and delete questions from the application's database. Additionally, administrators can create and delete quizzes, providing comprehensive control over the quiz content.

For users, the application provides an interactive quiz experience. Users can participate in quizzes, leveraging the intuitive user interface to navigate through questions and submit their responses.
